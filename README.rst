Aldryn Django Debug Toolbar
====

The Django Debug Toolbar is a configurable set of panels that display various debug information about the current request/response and when clicked, display more details about the panel&#39;s content.

This package is simply a wrapper around the famous Django application created by Rob Hudson to allow an easy installation on Aldryn.
